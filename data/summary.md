### Resumen:
When **Mr.** **Bilbo** Baggins of **Bag** **End** announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a **party** of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton. 

When **Bilbo** was ninety-nine he adopted **Frodo** as his heir, and brought him to live at **Bag** End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed. 

the fellowship of the ring  The eldest of these, and Bilbo’s favourite, was young **Frodo** Baggins. 

The history and character of **Mr.** **Bilbo** Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand. 

‘A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is **Mr.** Bilbo, as I’ve always said,’ the Gaffer declared. 

But be that as it may, **Mr.** **Frodo** is as nice a young **hobbit** as you could wish to meet. 

A decent respectable **hobbit** was **Mr.** Drogo Baggins; there was never much to tell of him, till he was drownded.’ 

I’d not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my dad’s cousin), but he    a long-expected **party** 31  had me up at **Bag** **End** helping him to keep folks from tram- pling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on.

### Resumen:
The conversation in The Green Dragon at Bywater, one evening in the spring of Frodo’s fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfortable heart of the **Shire** rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them.

the shadow of the past 79  ‘All the same,’ said Frodo, ‘even if **Bilbo** could not kill Gollum, I wish he had not kept the Ring. 

The second disappearance of Mr. **Bilbo** Baggins was dis- cussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all over the Shire, for a year and a day, and was remembered much longer than that. 

‘If only that dratted wizard will leave young **Frodo** alone, perhaps he’ll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense,’ they said. 

And to all appearance the wizard did leave **Frodo** alone, and he did settle down, but the growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable.

### Resumen:

said Frodo. 

Not far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree: it was still alive and had leaves on the small branches    three is company 101  that it had put out round the broken stumps of its long-fallen limbs; but it was hollow, and could be entered by a great crack on the **side** away from the road. 

He sat down on the bank at the **side** of the **road** and looked away east into the haze, beyond which lay the River, and the end of the Shire in which he had spent all his life. 

They had no time to find any  hiding-place better than the general darkness under the trees; **Sam** and Pippin crouched behind a large tree-bole, while **Frodo** crept back a few yards towards the lane. 

**Sam** walked along at Frodo’s side, as if in a dream, with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy. 

‘As for where I am going,’ said Frodo, ‘it would be difficult to give that away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.’

**Frodo** looked at **Sam** rather startled, half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him. 

said Frodo. 

‘I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,’ said **Sam** (in spite of private misgivings and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing). 

**Frodo** propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes.

**Merry** was tying it    130 the fellowship of the ring  up, and Pippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (who had been looking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper:  ‘Look back, Mr. Frodo! 

said Merry. 

I must be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen the old fellow’s secret book.’

### Resumen:
On the far side was a faint **path** leading up on to the floor of the Forest, a hundred yards and more beyond the Hedge; but it vanished as soon as it brought them under the trees. 

But the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees, and made a great bonfire in the Forest, and burned all the ground in a long strip east of the Hedge. 

There was not as yet any sign of a path, and the trees seemed constantly to bar their way. 

At the far side of the glade there was a break in the wall of trees, and a clear **path** beyond it. 

Just behind them a large branch fell from an old overhanging    148 the fellowship of the ring  **tree** with a crash into the path.

No one has ever caught old **Tom** walking in the forest, wading in the water, leaping on the hill-tops under light and shadow. 

These four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this **house** had driven from their minds: the **house** of **Tom** Bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of those dreaded hills. 

He is the Master of wood, water, and hill.’

### Resumen:
The vision melted into waking; and there was **Tom** whist- ling like a tree-full of birds; and the **sun** was already slanting **down** the **hill** and through the open window. 

It seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the Road, when they should be leaping, as lusty as Tom, over the stepping stones of the hills straight towards the Mountains. 

‘You won’t find your clothes again,’ said Tom, bounding **down** from the mound, and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight. 

**Tom** came out of the house and waved his hat and danced upon the doorstep, bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed.

### Resumen:
There were also many families of hobbits in the Bree-land; and they claimed to be the oldest settlement of Hobbits in the world, one that was founded long before even the Brandy- wine was crossed and the **Shire** colonized. 

The Shire-hobbits referred to those of Bree, and to any others that lived beyond the borders, as Outsiders, and took very little interest in them, considering them dull and uncouth. 

Strange as News from **Bree** was still a saying in the Eastfarthing, descending from those days, when news from North, South, and East could be heard in the inn, and when the Shire-hobbits used to go more often to hear it. 

On the benches were various folk: men of Bree, a collection of local hobbits (sitting chattering together), a few more dwarves, and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows and corners.

**Mr.** **Strider** may have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping; but if so, I should advise him to explain it.’ 

said Frodo, still determined not to understand Strider’s hints.

### Resumen:
asked Frodo. 

It was already mid-day when they drew near the southern end of the path, and saw before them, in the pale clear **light** of the October sun, a grey-green bank, leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the hill. 

‘I don’t know if the **Road** has ever been measured in miles beyond the Forsaken Inn, a day’s journey east of Bree,’ answered Strider. 

They could all see the black specks, but neither **Frodo** nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain; yet something told them that there, far below, were Black Riders assembling on the **Road** beyond the foot of the hill. 

**Strider** was watching the moonlight on the **hill** intently. 

A feeling of fear had been growing on him all day, and he was unable to rest or go to bed: there was a brooding threat in the breathless night-air.

### Resumen:
They started, and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo; but **Strider** knelt down swiftly at his side. 

And they needed fuel; for **Strider** said that **Frodo** must be kept warm, especially at night, while fire would be some protection for them all. 

‘I am afraid we must go back to the **Road** here for a while,’ said Strider. 

**Strider** made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the Road, while he went forward to explore. 

Here **Strider** turned aside, and soon they were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen hills. 

‘Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,’ said Strider, ‘and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive out.

### Resumen:
asked Frodo. 

In the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, there was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon, and so like was she in form of woman- hood to **Elrond** that **Frodo** guessed that she was one of his    296 the **fellowship** of the **ring**  close kindred. 

said Frodo. 

The braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost; her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth, and the **light** of stars was in her bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge were in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years bring. 

Such loveliness in living **thing** **Frodo** had never seen before nor imagined in his mind; and he was both surprised and abashed to find that he had a seat at Elrond’s table among all these folk so high and fair. 

**Frodo** learned that Grimbeorn the Old, son of Beorn, was now the lord of many sturdy men,    298 the **fellowship** of the **ring**  and to their land between the Mountains and Mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go. 

the **fellowship** of the **ring**  As **Elrond** entered and went towards the seat prepared for him, Elvish minstrels began to make sweet music.

### Resumen:
the fellowship of the **ring** 

‘Bring out the Ring, Frodo!’ said **Gandalf** solemnly. 

the fellowship of the **ring**  ‘Behold Isildur’s Bane!’ said Elrond. 

‘Some, Galdor,’ said Gandalf, ‘would think the tidings of Glóin, and the pursuit of Frodo, proof enough that the halfling’s trove is a **thing** of great worth to the Enemy. 

Tell them to bring news of anything that bears on this matter to Saruman and Gandalf. 

We can bide our time, we can keep our thoughts in our hearts, deploring maybe evils done by the way, but approving the high and ultimate purpose: Knowledge, Rule, Order; all the things that we have so far striven in vain to accomplish, hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends. 

Next **day** **Frodo** woke early, feeling refreshed and well. 

‘I feel ready for anything,’ answered Frodo. 

‘That is the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,’ cried Gandalf. ‘ 

**Gandalf** led them to the porch where **Frodo** had found his friends the evening before. 

To **Frodo**    312 the fellowship of the **ring**  his dangerous flight, and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world outside, already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream; but the faces that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave.

### Resumen:
the fellowship of the **ring** 

In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, **Frodo** and **Sam** were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room. 

On the morning of the last day **Frodo** was alone with Bilbo,    the **ring** goes south 361  and the old **hobbit** pulled out from under his bed a wooden box. 

**Sam** eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in his mind all the things that he had stowed in it, wondering if he had forgotten anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and the little box of salt that he always carried and refilled when he could; a good supply of pipe-weed (but not near enough, I’ll warrant); flint and tinder; woollen hose; linen; various small belongings of his master’s that **Frodo** had forgotten and **Sam** had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were called for. 

They passed through the lane; but hardly had **Frodo** touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall of stones and slithering snow. 

Merry and Pippin were indignant when they heard that **Sam** had crept into the Council, and had been chosen as Frodo’s companion. 

‘Well, anyway,’ said Bilbo, ‘nothing was decided beyond choosing poor **Frodo** and Sam.

### Resumen:
said Gandalf. 

In the wavering firelight **Gandalf** seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of **stone** set upon a hill. 

It was empty and silent, and hardly a trickle of **water** flowed among the brown and red-stained stones of its bed;    392 the fellowship of the ring  but on the near side there was a path, much broken and decayed, that wound its way among the ruined walls and paving-stones of an ancient highroad. 

To **Gandalf** the far-off memories of a **journey** long before were now of little help, but even in the gloom and despite all windings of the **road** he knew whither he wished to go, and he did not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal. 

‘We still have our **journey** and our errand before us,’  answered Gandalf. 

‘The **road** that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,’ said Gandalf. 

If we cannot cross the mountains, let us **journey** southwards, until we come to the Gap of Rohan, where men are friendly to my people, taking the **road** that I followed on my way hither. 

**Gandalf** will get votes easier in the **light** of the morning than in this cold gloom.

### Resumen:
But even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry had reached the stair outside, a huge orc-chieftain, almost man-high, clad in black mail from head to foot, leaped into the chamber; behind him his followers clustered in the door- way. 

There was another smaller **door** on the other **side** of the chamber, under the shaft. 

**Gandalf** paused and set a few leaves aside. 

cried Gandalf. 

With a quick movement **Gandalf** stepped before the nar- row opening of the **door** and thrust forward his staff.

### Resumen:
To the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end, and far lands could be descried beyond them, wide and vague. 

**Frodo** followed slowly, drawn by the still blue **water** in spite of hurt and weariness; Sam came up behind. 

‘Soon it becomes a swift river, and it gathers **water** from many other mountain-streams,’ said Aragorn. 

There are no trees like the trees of that land. 

While Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and fir-wood, and drew water, Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo. 

They had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree-clad slopes that climbed back westward towards the mountains. 

Its dark hurrying waters ran across    lothlórien 441  the path before them, and joined the Silverlode in a swirl of dim pools among the roots of trees.

### Resumen:
Night came beneath the trees as they walked, and the **Elves** uncovered their silver lamps. 

As he climbed slowly up **Frodo** passed many flets: some on one side, some on another, and some set about the bole    the mirror of galadriel 461  of the tree, so that the ladder passed through them. 

He rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf-fashion, saying: ‘Yet    464 the fellowship of the **ring**  more fair is the living land of Lórien, and the **Lady** Galadriel is above all the jewels that lie beneath the earth!’ 

The **Elves** spread for them a pavilion among the trees near the fountain, and in it they laid soft couches; then speaking words of peace with fair Elvish voices they left them.

### Resumen:
There are some among you who can handle boats: Legolas, whose folk know the swift Forest River; and Boromir of Gondor; and Aragorn the traveller.’ 

grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow fields by night, dusk- silver as **water** under the stars. 

Then they turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a deep thicket of mallorn- trees, and passed on, winding through rolling woodlands of silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards and east- wards, towards the shores of the River. 

The lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright margins: on the right and west the Silverlode flowed glittering; on the left and east the Great **River** rolled its broad waters, deep and dark.

### Resumen:
But no **boat** can live in Sarn Gebir, be it **night** or day.’ 

Not that most of the Company were eager to hurry southwards: they were content that the decision, which they must make at latest when they came to Rauros and the Tindrock Isle, still lay some days ahead; and they let the **River** bear them on at its own pace, having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond, whichever course they took in the end. 

On this side of the **River** they passed forests of great reeds, so tall that they shut out all view to the west, as the little boats went rustling by along their fluttering borders. 

It is a rich and pleasant land, and its grass has no rival; but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the **River** or ride often to its shores.
